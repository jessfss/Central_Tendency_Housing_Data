# Central_Tendency_Housing_Data
In this project, you will analyze the mean, median, and mode costs of one-bedroom apartments in three New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.  Using these statistics, you will draw conclusions about the cost of living in each borough and discuss an important assumption when comparing them.
